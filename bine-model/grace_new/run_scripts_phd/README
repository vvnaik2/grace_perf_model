This is a collection of scripts that I used for my phd thesis.
You have to modify them for your needs. I used them to run:
- STREAM benchmark
- Tinymembench
- NPB benchmark suite
- OpenBLAS (DGEMM)
- GROMACS (nonbonded benchmark and RNAse use case)
- GPAW (bmgs_fd and construct_density extracted kernels, see https://gitlab.jsc.fz-juelich.de/brank1/gpaw-benchmarks)
- Minife

Gem5 models are located in gem5/configs/common/cores/arm/.
Main models:
- O3_ARM_Neoverse_N1.py This is the main model that resembles Neoverse N1 backend

- O3_ARM_Neoverse_N1_128.py Same as Neoverse N1 but the sum reduction latency is changed to account for different SVE length
- O3_ARM_Neoverse_N1_256.py Same as Neoverse N1 but the sum reduction latency is changed to account for different SVE length
- O3_ARM_Neoverse_N1_512.py Same as Neoverse N1 but the sum reduction latency is changed to account for different SVE length
- O3_ARM_Neoverse_A64FX_512.py This is the same as N1 but the latencies of instructions have been modified to resemble the A64FX backend (basically much bigger latencies)


In order to change the number of SVE units, change (for example) line 98 'count = 2' in configs/common/cores/arm/O3_ARM_Neoverse_N1.py.
